## About openAR

openAR is a platform for artists (“Creators”) and collectors (“Collectors”) to sell and purchase digital art represented on non-fungible Ethereum-based tokens (“Digital Artwork”). 

**Smart-Contract Enabled.** The Digital Artwork on openAR is represented via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain xDai that provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on openAR (“Smart Contracts”). We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, the Ethereum network, your browser, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Platform. The infrastructure that represents  the Digital Artwork is therefore outside of the control of any one party, including openAR, and is subject to risks and uncertainties. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties. The User understands that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform. 

**Non-custodial.** While openAR offers a marketplace for Digital Artwork, it does not buy, sell, or ever take custody or possession of any Digital Artwork. The Platform facilitates User collection of Digital Artwork, but neither openAR nor the Platform are custodians of any Digital Artwork. The User understands and acknowledges that the Smart Contracts do not give openAR custody, possession, or control of any Digital Artwork or cryptocurrency at any time for the purpose of facilitating transactions on the Platform.  You affirm that you are aware and acknowledge that openAR is a non-custodial service provider and has designed this Platform to be directly accessible by the Users without any involvement or actions taken by openAR or any third party. As a marketplace, openAR cannot make any representation or guarantee that Creators will achieve any particular outcome as the result of listing their Digital Artwork on openAR.

The Creator hereby acknowledges, understands, and agrees that launching a Digital Artwork on openAR constitutes an express and affirmative grant to openAR, its affiliates and successors a non-exclusive, world-wide, assignable, sublicensable, perpetual, and royalty-free license to make copies of, display, perform, reproduce, and distribute the Digital Artwork on any media whether now known or later discovered for the broad purpose of operating, promoting, sharing, developing, marketing, and advertising the Platform, or any other purpose related to openAR, including without limitation, the express right to: (i) display or perform the Digital Artwork on the Platform, a third party platform, social media posts, blogs, editorials, advertising, market reports, virtual galleries, museums, virtual environments, editorials, or to the public; (ii) create and distribute digital or physical derivative Digital Artwork based on the Digital Artwork; (iii) indexing the Digital Artwork in electronic databases, indexes, catalogues; and (iv) hosting, storing, distributing, and reproducing one or more copies of the Digital Artwork within a distributed file keeping system, node cluster, or other database (e.g., IPFS) or causing, directing, or soliciting others to do so.

Collectors may display and share the Digital Artwork, but Collectors do not have any legal ownership, right, or title to any copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights to the Digital Artwork, excepting the limited license to the Digital Artwork granted by these Terms. Upon collecting a Digital Artwork, Collectors receive a limited, worldwide, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to display the Digital Artwork properly obtained by the Collector.

The Collector agrees that it may not, nor permit any third party, to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without the Creator’s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify, distort, mutilate, or perform any other modification to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Creator’s honor or reputation; (ii) use the Digital Artwork to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Digital Artwork in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iv) incorporate the Digital Artwork in movies, videos, video games, or any other forms of media for a commercial purpose, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted by these Terms or solely for your Collector’s personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain, or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Digital Artwork; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Digital Artwork; (vii) attempt to mint, tokenize, or create an additional cryptographic token representing the same Digital Artwork, whether on or off of the openAR Platform; (viii) falsify, misrepresent, or conceal the authorship of the Digital Artwork; or (ix) otherwise utilize the Digital Artwork for the Collector’s or any third party’s commercial benefit.

Collectors irrevocably release, acquit, and forever discharge openAR and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, and successors of any liability for direct or indirect copyright or trademark infringement for openAR use of a Digital Artwork in accordance with these Terms.

Creators expressly agree to refund to the Collector and/or openAR the entire portion of Fees received from the sale of a Digital Artwork that was subsequently removed from the Site pursuant to an effective copyright infringement. openAR will not be held liable to any User for removing allegedly infringing works from the Platform or otherwise fulfilling its legal obligations.

## Fees charged by openAR

**Fees.** The Fees for an initial sale of Digital Artwork on openAR are as follows:

- Creators receive 85% of the total sale price of an Initial Sale.
- openAR collects 15% of the total sale price of an Initial Sale.

You agree and understand that all fees, commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network. 

The Fees for a secondary sale of Digital Artwork on openAR (to be implemented) are as follows:

- Seller receives 85% of the total sale price of a Secondary Sale.
- Original Creator receives 10% of the total sale price of a Secondary Sale.
- openAR collects 5% of the total sale price of a Secondary Sale.

You agree and understand that all fees, commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network.

openAR does not generally collect any fees, commissions, or royalties for transactions occurring outside of openAR.

All transactions on openAR, including without limitation minting, tokenizing, listing, offering, purchasing, or confirming, are facilitated by smart contracts existing on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum network requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network, and thus every transaction occurring on openAR. The value of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of openAR. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract, agreement, offer, sale, or other transaction on openAR be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable.

**Taxes.** Users are responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority, associated with your use of openAR (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, sale, or creation of any artworks).

**Beta Platforms.**  Certain features on openAR may be offered while still in “beta” form (“Beta Platforms”). openAR will utilize best efforts to identify the Beta Platforms by labeling on its Platform. By accepting these Terms or using the Beta Platforms, you understand and acknowledge that the Beta Platforms are being provided as a “Beta” version and made available on an “As Is” or “As Available” basis. The Beta Platforms may contain bugs, errors, and other problems. You assume all risks and all costs associated with your use of the beta platforms. In addition, we are not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical, or other support for the Beta Platforms.

## Your Privacy
